	<p>Repackages the Passage Runtime artifacts of an existing release
		as Maven artifacts and optionally publishes them to Maven Central.</p>
	<p>This job uses the CBI aggregator to materialize the p2 artifacts
		to deploy into a Maven-style repository.</p>
	<p>
		For <a href="https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-guide/"
			target="_blank">publishing to OSSRH</a>, some information is missing:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The POM files are missing some required information.</li>
		<li>The required Javadoc jars need to be generated.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		To complete the POM files, a small utility, <em>pommod</em>, is
		contained in the releng project in form of a Maven Java project. This
		tool is first built via Maven and is later used to modify the POM
		files.
	</p>

	<p>The missing Javadocs are also automatically produced from the p2
		source bundles by this job.</p>

	<p>After these preparations for publishing are done:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The POM files will have been enriched with the required
			information by the <em>pommod</em> utility.
		</li>
		<li>The jars, including sources and javadocs, will have been
			added to the local Maven repository</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Finally, the shell script optionally deploys the jars, their sources,
		and their javadocs to OSSRH into a <a
			href="https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories" target="_blank">staging
			repository</a>. After uploading, the new staging repository must be
		closed and then released.
